CREATE PHOTO/VIDEO VIEWER.

TAKES THE STANDARD PHOTO AND VIDEO FORMATS (E.G. JPG, PNG, MP4, AVI, ETC.).

LETS USERS VIEW PHOTOS AND VIDEOS FROM THEIR COMPUTER; USER CAN SELECT ANY FILE OR FOLDER ON THEIR PC AND THE VIEWER LOADS THE PHOTOS/VIDEOS IN THAT FOLDER.

VIEWER CAN SCROLL FROM ONE ITEM TO THE NEXT (PHOTO → PHOTO, PHOTO → VIDEO, VIDEO → PHOTO) AS LONG AS THEY ARE IN THE SAME FOLDER.

IMPORTANT: USER HAS THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT THUMBNAILS OF PHOTOS/VIDEOS IN A GIVEN FOLDER IN ANY GRID CONFIGURATION OF THEIR CHOOSING. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THERE ARE 100 ITEMS IN FOLDER X, THE USER CAN ARRANGE THEM AS:

2 COLUMNS X 50 ROWS,

50 COLUMNS X 2 ROWS,

10 COLUMNS X 10 ROWS,

ETC.

IMPORTANT: THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS VIEWER IS TO LOOK AT ARRAYS OF PHOTOS/VIDEOS, NOT JUST SINGLE IMAGES. MOST USERS WILL BE LOOKING AT 5X5, 10X10, 20X20, ETC. ARRAYS. MAKE ARRAY VIEW FAST AND SMOOTH EVEN FOR LARGE FOLDERS.

WHEN LOOKING AT A PHOTO OR VIDEO, THE USER CAN ZOOM IN/OUT BY SCROLLING WITH THE MOUSE WHEEL (FORWARD = ZOOM IN, BACKWARD = ZOOM OUT).

USER CAN CREATE A SLIDESHOW; THERE IS A SLIDESHOW MODE.
WHEN DOING SLIDESHOW MODE, USER HAS THE OPTION OF HAVING THE SLIDESHOW SKIP THE VIDEOS.

IN ADDITION TO GRID/ARRAY VIEW, IMPLEMENT A “FILM STRIP” VIEW (HORIZONTAL STRIP OF THUMBNAILS WITH A LARGE PREVIEW ABOVE). USER HAS CONTROL OVER THE SIZE OF THE THUMBNAILS IN THE FILM STRIP (AT LEAST SMALL / MEDIUM / LARGE).

ADD A “GROUP BY THEME (AI)” FUNCTION THAT RUNS ENTIRELY LOCALLY (NO EXTERNAL API CALLS, WORKS EVEN ON NSFW CONTENT). USE A LOCAL CLIP-STYLE IMAGE EMBEDDING MODEL (OPEN-SOURCE, E.G. OPENCLIP OR EQUIVALENT) BUNDLED WITH THE APP.

DETAILS FOR THE LOCAL AI / CLIP IMPLEMENTATION:

ON FIRST VISIT TO A FOLDER:

GENERATE A THUMBNAIL FOR EACH PHOTO/VIDEO (FOR VIDEOS, USE A REPRESENTATIVE FRAME NEAR THE MIDDLE).

FEED THE THUMBNAIL TO THE LOCAL CLIP-STYLE MODEL AND COMPUTE A FIXED-LENGTH EMBEDDING VECTOR FOR EACH FILE.

STORE THESE EMBEDDINGS IN A LOCAL CACHE ON DISK (E.G. A SMALL LOCAL DATABASE OR INDEX FILE) SO THE FOLDER DOES NOT NEED TO BE RE-PROCESSED NEXT TIME. KEY BY FULL FILE PATH + LAST MODIFIED TIMESTAMP SO THAT CHANGES ARE DETECTED.

“GROUP BY THEME” FEATURE:

WHEN THE USER CLICKS “GROUP BY THEME”, LOAD THE PRECOMPUTED EMBEDDINGS FOR ALL ITEMS IN THE CURRENT FOLDER.

RUN A SIMPLE CLUSTERING STEP ON THESE EMBEDDINGS (ANY STANDARD CLUSTERING METHOD IS FINE; THE POINT IS TO GROUP ITEMS THAT ARE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER IN EMBEDDING SPACE).

USE THE RESULTING CLUSTERS TO CREATE VISUAL GROUPS:

EACH CLUSTER BECOMES ITS OWN ARRAY OF THUMBNAILS.

SHOW THESE CLUSTERS ONE AFTER ANOTHER VERTICALLY, OR AS TABS, OR AS COLLAPSIBLE SECTIONS.

FOR EACH CLUSTER, AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE A SIMPLE LABEL BY LOOKING AT THE MOST REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES IN THAT CLUSTER (FOR EXAMPLE: “INDOOR PORTRAITS”, “DOCUMENTS/SCANS”, “OUTDOOR/BEACH”, “SCREENSHOTS”). THIS CAN BE A SIMPLE, ROUGH TEXT LABEL; IT DOES NOT NEED TO BE PERFECT.

“ARRANGE BY SIMILARITY” FOR A SINGLE IMAGE:

WHEN USER RIGHT-CLICKS AN IMAGE (OR USES A MENU ITEM) AND CHOOSES “SHOW SIMILAR IMAGES”, TAKE THAT IMAGE’S EMBEDDING AND COMPUTE DISTANCES TO ALL OTHER EMBEDDINGS IN THE FOLDER.

SORT OTHER IMAGES BY DISTANCE (NEAREST FIRST) AND DISPLAY THEM AS A NEW ARRAY VIEW, WITH THE SELECTED IMAGE HIGHLIGHTED AT THE START.

THIS SHOULD WORK FOR BOTH PHOTOS AND VIDEOS (AGAIN USING THE REPRESENTATIVE FRAME FOR VIDEOS).

PERFORMANCE / CACHING:

ALL EMBEDDING COMPUTATION AND CLUSTERING MUST RUN LOCALLY AND ASYNCHRONOUSLY SO THE UI STAYS RESPONSIVE.

SHOW A SMALL STATUS INDICATOR WHEN THE APP IS FIRST INDEXING A LARGE FOLDER (“ANALYZING IMAGES…”) BUT ALLOW THE USER TO BROWSE NORMALLY WHILE THIS HAPPENS.

ONCE A FOLDER HAS BEEN INDEXED, “GROUP BY THEME” AND “ARRANGE BY SIMILARITY” SHOULD FEEL INSTANT.

PRIVACY AND SAFETY:

DO NOT SEND ANY IMAGES OR EMBEDDINGS TO ANY REMOTE SERVICE FOR THE CORE AI FEATURES.

ALL PROCESSING MUST BE LOCAL SO USERS CAN FREELY USE THE APP WITH ANY KIND OF CONTENT (INCLUDING NSFW) WITHOUT RISK OF API REJECTION OR ACCOUNT BANS.

UI REQUIREMENTS FOR AI FEATURES:

ADD A CLEAR BUTTON OR MENU ITEM LABELED “GROUP BY THEME (AI)” IN THE MAIN ARRAY VIEW TOOLBAR.

ADD A CONTEXT MENU ITEM ON EACH THUMBNAIL: “FIND SIMILAR (AI)” THAT OPENS A NEW ARRAY VIEW SORTED BY VISUAL SIMILARITY TO THE SELECTED ITEM.

IN SETTINGS, ADD A SIMPLE TOGGLE FOR “AI FEATURES” (ON/OFF). WHEN OFF, HIDE THE “GROUP BY THEME” AND “FIND SIMILAR” OPTIONS AND DO NOT LOAD THE MODEL.

FOCUS ON MAKING:

ARRAY VIEW FAST AND SMOOTH,

GROUP BY THEME AND FIND SIMILAR RELIABLE ENOUGH TO BE USEFUL,

ALL AI LOGIC ENTIRELY LOCAL AND ROBUST.
